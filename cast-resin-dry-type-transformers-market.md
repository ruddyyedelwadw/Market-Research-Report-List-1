<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cast Resin Dry-Type Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AN(Naturally-Cooled) Type</li><li>AF(Forced-air-Cooled) Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cast Resin Dry-Type Transformers are available in two main types: AN (Naturally-Cooled) Type and AF (Forced-air-Cooled) Type. AN Type transformers rely on natural convection for cooling, making them suitable for applications where air circulation is limited. On the other hand, AF Type transformers use fans to force air over the coils for more efficient cooling. The choice between the two types depends on factors such as the environment, installation space, and cooling requirements of the specific application.</p></p>

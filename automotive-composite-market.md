<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Composite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoset</li><li>Thermoplastics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive composite materials can be classified into two main types, thermoset and thermoplastics. Thermoset composites are materials that are permanently hardened by heat or chemical reaction, making them strong and rigid. These materials are typically used in structural components of vehicles due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. Thermoplastics, on the other hand, are more flexible and can be molded and reshaped multiple times when heated. These materials are often used in interior components and exterior panels of vehicles due to their ability to be easily formed into complex shapes.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Bonded Neodymium Magnets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injection Molding</li><li>Compression Molding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plastic bonded neodymium magnets are commonly manufactured using two main processes - injection molding and compression molding. In injection molding, the magnet material is melted and injected into a mold where it solidifies to form the desired shape. This process is well-suited for complex shapes and high volume production. On the other hand, compression molding involves compressing a mixture of magnet material and plastic into a mold under high pressure and temperature. This method is preferred for producing magnets with higher magnetic performance.</p></p>

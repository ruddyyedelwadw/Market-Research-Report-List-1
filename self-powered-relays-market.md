<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self Powered Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inverse Time Over Current Relays</li><li>Definite Time Over Current Relays</li><li>Instantaneous Current Relays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-powered relays are essential components in electrical protection systems. There are three main types in the market: Inverse Time Over Current Relays, Definite Time Over Current Relays, and Instantaneous Current Relays. </p><p>Inverse Time Over Current Relays provide protection by tripping the circuit breaker after a certain time delay inversely proportional to the fault current. Definite Time Over Current Relays have a fixed time delay before tripping the breaker. Instantaneous Current Relays trip instantly when the current exceeds a preset threshold. Each type offers specific benefits for protecting electrical systems from overcurrent faults.</p></p>

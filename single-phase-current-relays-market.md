<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-Phase Current Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Under-Current Detection</li><li>Over-Current Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-phase current relays are commonly used for under-current detection, which is when the current falls below a certain threshold, and over-current detection, which is when the current exceeds a certain threshold. Under-current detection relays help protect electrical equipment from damage due to insufficient current, while over-current detection relays prevent overloads and potential hazards. Both types of relays play a crucial role in maintaining the safety and efficiency of electrical systems by promptly detecting and responding to abnormal current levels.</p></p>

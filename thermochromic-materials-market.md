<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermochromic Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible Thermochromic Materials</li><li>Irreversible Thermochromic Materials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermochromic materials can be divided into two main types: reversible and irreversible. Reversible thermochromic materials change color temporarily when exposed to heat, and return to their original color when cooled down. These materials are commonly used in applications such as mood rings and thermometers. Irreversible thermochromic materials, on the other hand, permanently change color when exposed to heat and do not revert back to their original color. These materials are often used in security features on valuable documents and packaging.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coffee Harvesters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vibration Picking Machine (Derricadeira)</li><li>Stripping Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coffee harvesters are divided into two main types: vibration picking machines (Derricadeira) and stripping machines. Vibration picking machines use vibrations to shake the coffee cherries off the tree, allowing for a more selective and gentle harvest. On the other hand, stripping machines strip the entire branch of cherries at once, resulting in a faster but less precise harvest. Both machines have their advantages and are widely used in the coffee industry for efficient harvesting.</p></p>

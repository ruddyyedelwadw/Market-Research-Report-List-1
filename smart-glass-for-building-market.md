<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Glass for Building Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Glasses</li><li>Passive Glasses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart glass for building can be classified into two main types: active glasses and passive glasses. Active glasses use technologies like electrochromic or liquid crystal to change their transparency in response to an external stimuli like electricity. Passive glasses, on the other hand, rely on characteristics like photochromism or thermochromism to automatically adjust their transparency based on environmental conditions such as light or temperature. Both types of smart glass offer innovative solutions for enhancing energy efficiency, privacy, and comfort in buildings.</p></p>

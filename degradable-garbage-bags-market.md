<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Degradable Garbage Bags Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biodegradable Materials</li><li>Photodegradable Materials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Degradable garbage bags can be classified into two main market types: biodegradable materials and photodegradable materials. Biodegradable materials are made from organic matter that can break down naturally over time through the action of microorganisms. These bags are environment-friendly as they do not contribute to long-term pollution. On the other hand, photodegradable materials are designed to break down when exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation. This type of degradation occurs through a chemical process that weakens the bag's structure, allowing it to disintegrate into smaller pieces over time.</p></p>

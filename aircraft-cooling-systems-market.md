<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Cooling Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cycle Air Conditioning</li><li>Vapor Cycle Air Conditioning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft cooling systems can be categorized into two main types: Air Cycle Air Conditioning and Vapor Cycle Air Conditioning. Air Cycle Air Conditioning systems use compressed air to cool the cabin through expansion and compression processes. On the other hand, Vapor Cycle Air Conditioning systems utilize a refrigerant to absorb heat from the cabin and release it outside the aircraft. Both types of systems play a crucial role in maintaining a comfortable temperature for passengers and crew members during flights.</p></p>

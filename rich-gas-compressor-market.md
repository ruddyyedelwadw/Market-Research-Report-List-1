<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rich Gas Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Airtight</li><li>Non-airtight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rich gas compressor market can be categorized into two main types: airtight and non-airtight. In airtight compressors, the gas is compressed within a sealed chamber without any leakage, ensuring efficient and effective compression of rich gases. On the other hand, non-airtight compressors may allow some gas to escape during the compression process, which can result in lower efficiency and potentially environmental concerns. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on specific requirements and operating conditions.</p></p>

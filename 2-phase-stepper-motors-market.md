<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2-Phase Stepper Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar Type</li><li>Unipolar Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>2-Phase stepper motors come in two main types, bipolar and unipolar. Bipolar motors have one winding per phase and require a reverse current to change direction, making them more powerful but more complex to drive. Unipolar motors have a center-tapped winding per phase, allowing for simpler control by switching the current on and off in each winding. Bipolar motors are well-suited for high performance applications, while unipolar motors are often used in simpler systems where ease of control is a priority.</p></p>

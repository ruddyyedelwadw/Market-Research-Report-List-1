<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LCOS based Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) Modules</li><li>MEMS based Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) Modules</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) Modules are devices used in optical communication networks to dynamically route different wavelengths of light. There are two main types of WSS modules: LCOS-based and MEMS-based. LCOS-based modules use liquid crystal on silicon technology to selectively switch wavelengths, offering high resolution and low insertion loss. MEMS-based modules use micro-electromechanical system technology for switching wavelengths, providing fast response times and low power consumption. Both types play a crucial role in enabling flexible and efficient wavelength management in optical networks.</p></p>
